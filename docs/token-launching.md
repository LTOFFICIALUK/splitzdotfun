- **Platform Fee**: 1% automatically deducted

**Adding Recipients:**
1. Click "Add Recipient" for each person you want to share royalties with
2. Choose recipient type:

   - **Social Handle**: @username for social media influencers
3. Set percentage allocation (0-100%)
4. Add descriptive label for easy identification

**Recipient Types:**

**Wallet Address Recipients:**

**Royalty Distribution Strategy:**

**Creator-Heavy (80-100% to creator):**

- Building initial community and momentum
- Planning to add recipients later
