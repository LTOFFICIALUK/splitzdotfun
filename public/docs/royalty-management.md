# Royalty Management Guide

Royalty management is the core feature that makes SplitzFun unique. This guide explains how royalty distribution works, how to configure it effectively, and how to maximize earnings for all participants.

## What Are Royalties?

Royalties are automatic payments made to creators, influencers, and community members every time a token is traded. Think of them as ongoing revenue sharing that rewards those who contribute to a token's success.

### How Royalties Work

1. **Automatic Collection**: Every token trade includes a royalty fee (typically 5-10%)
2. **Smart Distribution**: Royalties are automatically split among configured recipients
3. **Real-Time Payments**: Recipients receive payments immediately upon transaction
4. **Transparent Tracking**: All distributions are publicly verifiable on-chain

## Royalty Structure

### Standard Royalty Rates

**Transaction Royalty**: 5-10% of each trade value
- **Platform Fee**: 1% (automatically deducted)
- **Creator Share**: 99% (distributed to recipients)
- **Net Distribution**: 99% of the 5-10% royalty

### Example Calculation

```
Trade Value: 1 SOL
Royalty Rate: 8%
Total Royalty: 0.08 SOL
Platform Fee: 0.0008 SOL (1%)
Available for Distribution: 0.0792 SOL (99%)

Recipient Distribution:
- Creator: 50% = 0.0396 SOL
- Influencer A: 30% = 0.02376 SOL
- Community Member: 20% = 0.01584 SOL
```

## Setting Up Royalty Distribution

### Initial Configuration

When you first launch a token, you start with 100% of royalties going to you (the creator). You can then add recipients and adjust percentages as your community grows.

**Step 2: Choose Recipient Type**

**Wallet Address Recipients:**

- Immediate payment upon transaction
- No additional verification required
- Best for: Developers, designers, advisors, early supporters

**Social Handle Recipients:**
- Payments routed through social media verification
- Requires social media account verification
- Automatic payment based on content creation
- Best for: Influencers, content creators, community managers

**Step 3: Configure Distribution**

**Percentage Allocation:**
- Set the percentage each recipient should receive
- Total should not exceed 100%
- Can be adjusted at any time
- Changes take effect immediately

**Recipient Labels:**
- Add descriptive names for easy identification
