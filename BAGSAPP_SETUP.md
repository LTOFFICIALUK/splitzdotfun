# BagsApp API Integration Setup Guide

This guide explains how to set up the BagsApp API integration for token launching on SplitzFun with shared fees.

## Prerequisites

1. **BagsApp API Key**: Get your API key from [dev.bags.fm](https://dev.bags.fm)
2. **Solana Wallet**: Any Solana-compatible wallet (Phantom, Solflare, etc.)
3. **SOL Balance**: At least 0.05 SOL for deployment fees

## Environment Variables

Add the following environment variables to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
# BagsApp API Configuration
BAGS_API_KEY=your_bags_api_key_here
SOLANA_RPC_URL=https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com

# Optional: For development/testing
NODE_ENV=development
```

## Installation

The required dependencies are already installed:

```bash
npm install @bagsfm/bags-sdk @solana/web3.js bs58
```

## How It Works

### 1. Token Creation Flow

1. User visits `/create` page
2. Fills out token details (name, symbol, description, images)
3. Configures royalty distribution
4. Clicks "Launch Token"
5. Frontend calls `/api/launch-token` endpoint
6. Backend integrates with BagsApp Shared Fees API
7. Token is created with shared fees (100% platform fees)
8. Contract address (CA) is generated and used for the token URL
9. User is redirected to token page at `https://splitz.fun/token/{CA}`

### 2. Shared Fees Configuration

- **Platform Fee**: 100% goes to `@splitzdotfun` (platform custodial wallet)
- **Fee Claiming**: Platform fees are available for users to claim
- **Website URL**: Each token gets a unique URL: `https://splitz.fun/token/{CA}` (using contract address)

### 3. Contract Address Implementation

The token contract address (CA) is generated by the BagsApp API and used throughout the system:

- **Token URL**: `https://splitz.fun/token/{CA}` - Direct link to token page
- **Database Storage**: Contract address stored as primary identifier
- **API Endpoints**: All token operations use the contract address
- **Marketplace**: Token listings reference the contract address
- **Analytics**: Performance tracking uses contract address as key

### 4. API Parameters

The BagsApp Shared Fees API receives the following parameters:

```typescript
{
  imageUrl: string,                    // Token image URL
  name: string,                       // Token name
  symbol: string,                     // Token symbol
  description: string,                // Token description
  twitterUrl: string,                 // Twitter/X URL
  websiteUrl: string,                 // Generated website URL using contract address (CA)
  initialBuyAmountLamports: number,   // Initial buy amount in lamports
  feeClaimerTwitterUsername: 'splitzdotfun',  // Platform custodial wallet
  creatorFeeBps: 0,                  // 0% for creator
  feeClaimerFeeBps: 10000,           // 100% for fee claimer (10000 basis points)
  creatorTwitterUsername: 'launchonsplitz'    // Our platform creator account
}

**Implementation Note**: The contract address is generated by the BagsApp API and used to create the final website URL. The system stores this contract address in the database and uses it for all subsequent operations including marketplace listings, analytics, and user interactions.
```

## Security Considerations

- **Private Keys**: Never stored on the server
- **API Keys**: Stored securely in environment variables
- **Wallet Signing**: All transactions signed on client side
- **OAuth Flows**: Secure social media authentication
- **Fee Distribution**: Transparent and automated through smart contracts

## Testing

For development/testing, the API includes a demo mode that simulates token creation without making actual blockchain transactions.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Missing API Key**: Ensure `BAGS_API_KEY` is set in environment variables
2. **Invalid Wallet**: Check that wallet address format is correct
3. **Insufficient SOL**: Ensure wallet has at least 0.05 SOL for fees
4. **Network Issues**: Check Solana RPC URL and network connectivity
5. **Shared Fees Setup**: Ensure Twitter usernames are correctly configured

### Error Messages

- `"BAGS_API_KEY environment variable is required"`: Set your API key
- `"Invalid wallet address format"`: Check wallet address
- `"Missing required fields"`: Fill in all required form fields
- `"Transaction failed to confirm"`: Network or fee issues
- `"Shared fees setup failed"`: Check Twitter username configuration

## Production Deployment

1. Set production environment variables
2. Use production Solana RPC endpoint
3. Ensure proper error handling and logging
4. Test with small amounts first
5. Monitor transaction success rates
6. Verify shared fees distribution
